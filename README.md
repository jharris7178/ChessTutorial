In this chess tutorial, users will be able to select a starting square on the chess board and any chess piece. The red square indicates
the starting position of the piece (that the user selected) and the blue squares represent anywhere that piece can legally move. This file
is a great way for new chess players to learn how the pieces move around the board.
